# Security-Policies for organisation: Reboot Games


## Outline of business:
#### The business that will be outlined will be Reboot Games, the business is a games production company that focuses on rebooting older titles and then applying different modern aspects to it to improve it more. To create and design these rebooted games, there must be the required software and hardware that will allow the company to reboot the games and finish off its projects. Some of the hardware and software will be expensive as it will be needed to run and create the rebooted games that might require better graphics for it to run. The number of staff that are apart of Reboot Games is 15, each staff member uses the same system and the same software that is to create the games. The company has two owners, and 13 workers, each worker has a specific role within the company, this then helps the company function as a team as each member also has different tasks to each of the projects and also this allows completion of work to a sustainable rate.


## Threats in an organisation:
#### In an organisation, there are many threats that could affect the company from loss of data and other problems. These threats can come from anywhere such as hackers trying to gain access to the system by sending in a virus of some kind to one of the employees. Organisations must know how to prevent these exploits from happening such as a natural disaster, internal leaks and ethical hacking. Natural disasters such as a fire/flood or earthquake/tsunami or even a power cut can be averted as the data can be stored in several locations so that if the data will be lost including with the hardware this then won't be as big of a problem as the data will still be available but the hardware will have to be replaced.
#### Internal leaks and ethical hacking is one of the most popular types of threats that an organisation may face as these sometimes happen on a regular basis. Internal leaks are when an employee have some specific data that could be vital for the company, this might be for a new product that won't be shown till a certain date. This data can also be something that might expose the company on how they deal with their business or something that might make them lose a lot of revenue. Most companies usually have a non-disclosure form in which the employee must sign so that information cannot be leaked and if they're caught, then the company can sure that person from breaching the form. Accidental leaks can happen as well but is very rare as sometimes accidental leaks may cause more damage to the company. 
#### Ethical hacking usually is done when a hacker is able to find a weakness within a certain part of the company, as it is an easy access point for them. There are also the different types of malicious software that hackers can use such as, Trojan Horse, Worms, Rootkit, etc. Some of these are hard to recognise such as the Trojan Horse as this one hides underneath other files that may go through a firewall and then destroy or corrupt data in the system. A good way of making sure this does not happen, anti-virus checks should occur once a day to make sure that there are not any that have entered the system. Also another way is to have a separate network that is secured from the public and also have a public one so that client may observe the product/service. 

## Group Risks
#### Risks in an organisation can be put into groups, these groups classify the types of risks that affect an organisation, these groups are Physical, Data and Social Engineering.
### Physical:
#### Physical risks are involed with things that interact physically with the system or the user, for example a natural disaster such as fire/flood. This risk is physical as it physically burns the systems or floods through the building where the systems are, these risks do not happen very often and so the solutions for stopping this is just to back up the files and try and keep most of the hardware safe and together to prevent from becoming destroyed. Another risk can be a power cut which can affect when employees are working as this might turn off their systems when working which then cause work that is not saved to not exist anymore, which will affect in time to catch up with that work.
### Data:
#### 
### Social Engineering:

How to keep your system Secure

Here i will show a list of things that you could do to try and keep your system secure:

HTTPS

Everyone should already know what this means and why it is there. So having HTTPS means that the website you are surfing on is secure from any threats that may try to go into that specific website. If it does not have the 'S' on the end which stands for Secure this means that that specific website can have some threats to access through into that website and then possibly onto your system.

HTTPS EVERYWHERE(check each website that it has HTTPS) TOR/VPN AD BLOCKERS Avoid using patterns in passwords Logout accounts Use Incognito Use Non-traceable Search Engines such as DuckDuckGo Use different emails for Public usage and for Personal usage. Donâ€™t share personal information Turn off your mics Turn off location history Turn off camera/webcam on laptop Turn off bluetooth Use different passwords Always check the url when browse websites Clear cookies and history often
