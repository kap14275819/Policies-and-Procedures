How to keep your system Secure

Here i will show a list of things that you could do to try and keep your system secure:

HTTPS

Everyone should already know what this means and why it is there. So having HTTPS means that the website you are surfing on is secure from any threats that may try to go into that specific website. If it does not have the 'S' on the end which stands for Secure this means that that specific website can have some threats to access through into that website and then possibly onto your system.

HTTPS EVERYWHERE(check each website that it has HTTPS) TOR/VPN AD BLOCKERS Avoid using patterns in passwords Logout accounts Use Incognito Use Non-traceable Search Engines such as DuckDuckGo Use different emails for Public usage and for Personal usage. Donâ€™t share personal information Turn off your mics Turn off location history Turn off camera/webcam on laptop Turn off bluetooth Use different passwords Always check the url when browse websites Clear cookies and history often
