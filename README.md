# Security-Policies for organisation: Reboot Games


## Outline of business:
#### The business that will be outlined will be Reboot Games, the business is a games production company that focuses on rebooting older titles and then applying different modern aspects to it to improve it more. To create and design these rebooted games, there must be the required software and hardware that will allow the company to reboot the games and finish off its projects. Some of the hardware and software will be expensive as it will be needed to run and create the rebooted games that might require better graphics for it to run. The number of staff that are apart of Reboot Games is 15, each staff member uses the same system and the same software that is to create the games. The company has two owners, and 13 workers, each worker has a specific role within the company, this then helps the company function as a team as each member also has different tasks to each of the projects and this allows completion of work to a sustainable rate.


## Threats in an organisation:
#### In an organisation, there are many threats that could affect the company from loss of data and other problems. These threats can come from anywhere such as hackers trying to gain access to the system by sending in a virus of some kind to one of the employees. Organisations must know how to prevent these exploits from happening such as a natural disaster, internal leaks and ethical hacking. Natural disasters such as a fire/flood or earthquake/tsunami or even a power cut can be averted as the data can be stored in several locations so that if the data will be lost including with the hardware this then won't be as big of a problem as the data will still be available but the hardware will have to be replaced.
#### Internal leaks and ethical hacking is one of the most popular types of threats that an organisation may face as these sometimes happen on a regular basis. Internal leaks are when an employee have some specific data that could be vital for the company, this might be for a new product that won't be shown till a certain date. This data can also be something that might expose the company on how they deal with their business or something that might make them lose a lot of revenue. Most companies usually have a non-disclosure form in which the employee must sign so that information cannot be leaked and if they're caught, then the company can sure that person from breaching the form. Accidental leaks can happen as well but is very rare as sometimes accidental leaks may cause more damage to the company. 
#### Ethical hacking usually is done when a hacker is able to find a weakness within a certain part of the company, as it is an easy access point for them. There are also the different types of malicious software that hackers can use such as, Trojan Horse, Worms, Rootkit, etc. Some of these are hard to recognise such as the Trojan Horse as this one hides underneath other files that may go through a firewall and then destroy or corrupt data in the system. A good way of making sure this does not happen, anti-virus checks should occur once a day to make sure that there are not any that have entered the system. Also, another way is to have a separate network that is secured from the public and have a public one so that client may observe the product/service. 

## Group Risks
#### Risks in an organisation can be put into groups, these groups classify the types of risks that affect an organisation, these groups are Physical, Data and Social Engineering.
### Physical:
#### Physical risks are involved with things that interact physically with the system or the user, for example a natural disaster such as fire/flood. This risk is physical as it physically burns the systems or floods through the building where the systems are, these risks do not happen very often and so the solutions for stopping this is just to back up the files and try and keep most of the hardware safe and together to prevent from becoming destroyed. Another risk can be a power cut which can affect when employees are working as this might turn off their systems when working which then cause work that is not saved to not exist anymore, which will affect in time to catch up with that work that was lost.
### Data:
#### Data risks has several types of risks such as corruption, destruction of data, data tampering or even theft. These risks are usually done by hackers who try to send off malicious software such as Worm, Trojan Horse and Rootkit which then can corrupt, steal or just destroy data within the system depending on what way they have affected the system. Data risks can also be internal as an employee might send information to another company or purposely leak information to the public. If information was lost of leaked this can then go into the loss of trust in the company as clients might not want to buy from then anymore and will then have the loss of revenue for the company.
### Social Engineering:
#### The final one which is Social Engineering and this is the risk group about social techniques, this is where the attacker will focus on the clients/users of the systems in order to gain access. The way the attack will do this is by either sending a Phishing email that will then acquire the details or by USB baiting which is when a USB is found or placed within a computer, which then the USB that is programmed to install a virus of some kind to then gain access. An easy way of doing this is to make sure that each employee does check emails or other items sent to them to make sure they do not allow anything to get into the system, or to use external USB/hard drives that then might have a virus.

## Security Procedures for Reboot Games
#### In this section this will show all the different types of security procedures within Reboot Games and how they can be achieved. Different companies operate in unique ways that allow their employees to operate within set procedures, these are set in place for the employees so that the company can sustainable working as a unit. This allows better security within a company, such as one procedure that is in place for most companies is that each employee must have a form of ID when entering the building, this means that only personnel who have an ID have access to the building. This procedure allows the company to have a way of protecting it from unwanted individuals from entering the building.
#### Similar procedures of security are also in place within Reboot Games, which also allows the protection for unwanted breaches of security, such as:


### ID pass:
#### Within the college that Reboot Games is located in, there are a set of gates that each student/staff must get through in order to gain access into the college. To enter you must be in the system in case you have misplaced your card or you have your ID that can allow you access through the gates, the ID pass can be retrieved from the college itself and this also has identity onto the college system. There is no other way of bypassing this procedure, unless the individual would obtain one the ID cards that a student has misplaced. The procedure to enter the building is:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Approach Gate
##### 3. Hold correct ID card
##### 4. Place card over required area and wait for light to turn green
##### 5. Wait for gates to open
##### 6. Walk through gate opening
##### 7. Gate closes behind once walked through
#### The steps for this procedure are very basic and despite this they are important when taking safety into consideration, this is because the simple method of ID cards can be very effective at stopping unwanted individuals or groups from coming into the college.

#### In the event that the card is misplaced or that the card is not working on the gates, the following steps must be taken:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Walk to the reception desk and wait in front
##### 3. If there is a queue then wait in the queue
##### 4. Talk to receptionist about gaining entry
##### 5. Acquire either a guest pass or stamp to allow you through
##### 6. Continue to desired location

### Door Lock:
#### The ID card can be used for multiple areas also within the college, if you have the high-level access to it. Many doors within the college cannot be opened unless a valid pass is acquired, this means that only personnel that have higher ranking access can enter through those doors. Some students are able to access certain areas as they have been granted access to use that specific room, everyone else is able to access the college but may not be able to access the other rooms unless granted access to it, this is to make sure that only more trusted individuals can have access to the room. In order to gain access, you must have the authorized ID card to access these areas, to access certain doors the following steps must be taken:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Pass gate with the previous steps
##### 3. Locate door that you want to access
##### 4. Ensure you have the authorisation to access the room
##### 5. Place ID card on required area
##### 6. Wait for red light to turn green and hear lock sound
##### 7. Proceed to push or pull the door to open.
#### This procedure is in place to make sure that if an individual would somehow gain access into the college then they would have to do another step to make it into more areas within the college, this increases the security of the area as it is another step for any attacker to bypass.

#### In the event of not having a required ID in order to open the door, the following steps must be taken:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Pass gate with the previous steps
##### 3. Locate door you want to access
##### 4. Find member of staff with required ID access
##### 5. Wait for staff member to open the door for you
##### 6. Enter room

### Regular Search:
#### This is a security procedure that occurs a few times during the year. This is done by having a security team at the front of the main gates with metal detectors, this allows both staff and students to be searched to see if they are in possession of any items in which should not be in the premises. This search is done by the local police and are very beneficial for the college and Reboot Games from not having any dangerous items that may cause problems. The steps that are taken to go through the search are:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Wait in queue
##### 3. Move forward in queue until reach metal detectors
##### 4. Follow police's instructions
##### 5. Have bag searched if in possession of one
##### 6. Walk through the metal detector when told
##### 7. Retrieve items once completed
#### This procedure may change depending on the time you have entered the college, whether an item has been found or if there is a bigger queue. If there is no queue at all then this step can be skipped entirely.

### Uploading work
#### This procedure is done when business members upload work onto the internet in order for the owners of Reboot Games are able to view it, this is all done on a public domain but it is all subjected to copyright so that the work cannot be plagiarised. This work is all available on this site but can be updated or manually removed by the owner who has created that certain piece of work, because of this level of security means that it is a safe place for the work to be stored. The steps that are taken to access the site and upload work are:

##### 1. Locate computer system that will be used
##### 2. Turn on system and log into account
##### 3. Use any working search engine
##### 4. Search website 'GitHub' and login
##### 5. Locate and enter repository of choice
##### 6. Update information on repository
##### 7. Accept changes
#### By regularly checking the public domain and updating any changes needed allows you to make sure that your work is safe and cannot be copied as it is covered by the copyright act.
#### If there is not internet to upload work then follow these steps instead:

##### 1. Locate computer system that will be used
##### 2. Turn on system and log into account
##### 3. Open up a text editor e.g. Microsoft Word
##### 4. Write down information that you want to update
##### 5. Save it on a reliable storage device
##### 6. Wait until internet connection is made
##### 7. Copy and paste information into repo and confirm changes
#### These procedures are all used to cover different potential vulnerabilities that a system can have, the different stages can only be bypassed if certain procedures are already met, for example unless an ID card is present, the door will not be unlocked. This shows how by having simple security procedures, a company can keep themselves protected.


## Incorrect configuration of firewall policies and third party VPNs

### Third party VPN's and internal leaks
#### Every company and people at home can use a variety of methods in order to make sure that their system is protected, most of these methods are very common such as a password, firewall etc. One way that people will sometimes use is setting up a VPN (Virtual Party Network), these are used to allow safe data transfer online usually when sending data. These packets of data have to travel to public domains in order to have the data successfuly transferred. However, a VPN creates a private connection that involves two IP addresses connecting with each other, this then allows the two system to transfer files or data to each other. This then allows the files to go through a private network rather than putting it on a public domain in which it could be seen and tracked.

#### If these are implemented into a system they can be extremely useful for whoever has it on their system, there are also some big drawbacks when using third party VPN's, since it is a private network you will need to have a provider. Many companies also offer VPN's but this can be quite risky acquiring one this way. As the private network from companies can have many ways of having the data internally leaked to the public domain. Whether this is by accident or intentional, there can be leaks of data that can betray the entire point of the private network and can impact a company quite heavily depending on the type of data leaked, also if the data is extremely important then it could potentially be fatal for the business.

### Wrong firewall configuation
#### VPN's can keep data safe when being transferred across systems, however it isn't the only thing that can protect data when being transferred. It is common knowledge of what firewalls do, they protect your computer from malicious data that are trying to get into the system. However, because of how it functions by allowing access to some packets and blocking packets that aren't allowed in, whether it is because they are harmful or because it is against the admins rules. If the firewall is configured incorrectly, it can mean that many packets that are not harmful but actually important can be lost when sent, this can cause parts of private data to be lost that is vital for the user. Having data lost within the system that is important to certain projects can cause many different problems ranging from trivial to fatal, also from the other side, properly configured firewalls keep malicious packets out whereas firewalls that are not properly configured will allow malicious packets in after thinking there is no malicious data within.

## Increasing security in Reboot Games

### DMZ
#### A DMZ or a Demilitarised Zone is a sub network that has a function that is able to split and separate an internal or private home LAN from any public network, this then can be used to allow people to access a webpage that is hosted on this network, but will not be able to access the home network from that. For example, an email server can be placed in a DMZ and allow different groups to access the servers, this can come from an internal source or external, however as the server is disconnected from the main LAN it cannot be accessed through the email server.

#### Acquiring one of the DMZ's can be extremely helpful to a company as the servers will then be able to be safely accessed by all sources without having the main LAN in danger from being breached. This helps the company as it will allow them to have their personal server disconnected from the server the clients are accessing. This then creates another layer of security to the business and creates safer server management, as well as the event of an attack can be prevented from not happening as it only affect the DMZ and not the LAN.

### Static IP's
#### An IP address is used to give a network an address similar to how house numbers and streets names work, this can be used to locate different networks which then can be used to locate if any malicious software was sent from. Since this is the address of the network, this is then vital for the networks to communicate with each other. The difference with Static IP is that this is a manually configured IP that is built for a specific device, and so this will stay always the same with the device unlike normal IP's will change depending on the network.

#### Whilst using a static IP address this allows you to add security measures to that specific IP which then allows for a lot more configuration and security whilst a firewall that follows an ever-changing IP cannot. This method is a consistent way to add another layer of security, this layer that is added is a very simple and easy way to protect a certain device within a network.

### NAT
#### NAT or Network Address Translation is a method of giving a device that is within a private network a public address, this new address is correctly configured which then adds a layer of security. Since this now has a new IP address, the internal IP is hidden and once a network is accessed, this will then be accessed by the new public IP instead of the private one. This creates more security to the IP as this will then confuse the attackers at they will try to gain access but won't as the public address be covering the private one.

## Disaster recovery within Reboot Games
#### When dealing with risks in a business such as ethical hacking or a natural disaster and these damage the business in any major way, then there has to be some type of plan ready to make sure that this contained and managed so that it does not become catastrophic for the business. This will show some of the way to plan from disasters. 

### The Recovery process and recovery time
#### This is when the business will look over all the projects and other work that they have done and prioritise them depending on their importance on the company. Once sorted the important pieces of work will have higher amounts of protection because if they are lost or stolen, then it will be crucial for the company as it will be difficult to recover from. The less important assets will be the least protected so if in the event of an attack, these will be the first that will be lost/corrupted. Doing this will allow less disasters from happening as it will only have least important assets that will have to be recovered.

#### The recovery time is a very simple step in the disaster recovery process, this is because it is all about how fast the recovery process can be completed. This can also be used to define the amount of time before a disaster occurs which means that it will be a more organised recovery plan, this will then show the business an estimated time of when operations will be running back to normal. This can also identify flaws in the recovery process because if it took longer to recover than it should have, this can then be analysed and fixed so that it will speed up the recovery time.


### Communication plan
#### The communication plan involves making sure that the communication between each of the employees within the company is set to the task at hand and that the correct questions are being asked when a disaster is occurring at that time. This then makes sure that the disaster is being recovered as quickly as possible. If done correctly and every employee follow the procedures and listen to what has to be done at hand then there won't be any more problems occurring during the process.


### Defining roles to employees
#### Whilst a disaster is occurring, it is important that each of the employees know exactly what they are doing so that more problems will not occur during the process. Giving each of the employees a specific role/task to do will then have the process more organised when diverting the disaster. By not defining roles to the employees will then not keep the process clean and organised, it will then cause chaos within the business as nobody knows what they have to do exactly.

## Testing schedule
#### Having a testing schedule allows you to keep track regularly on all of the disaster recoveries that have happened before, this can also be used to reflect of the previous disasters to make sure it does not occur again. This also allows the preparation of employees as it can be checked on how well they dealt with the disaster and then this can be looked on to improve that so that it will give a higher chance of success when a disaster occurs.
