# Security-Policies for organisation: Reboot Games


## Outline of business:
#### The business that will be outlined will be Reboot Games, the business is a games production company that focuses on rebooting older titles and then applying different modern aspects to it to improve it more. To create and design these rebooted games, there must be the required software and hardware that will allow the company to reboot the games and finish off its projects. Some of the hardware and software will be expensive as it will be needed to run and create the rebooted games that might require better graphics for it to run. The number of staff that are apart of Reboot Games is 15, each staff member uses the same system and the same software that is to create the games. The company has two owners, and 13 workers, each worker has a specific role within the company, this then helps the company function as a team as each member also has different tasks to each of the projects and also this allows completion of work to a sustainable rate.


## Threats in an organisation:
#### In an organisation, there are many threats that could affect the company from loss of data and other problems. These threats can come from anywhere such as hackers trying to gain access to the system by sending in a virus of some kind to one of the employees. Organisations must know how to prevent these exploits from happening such as a natural disaster, internal leaks and ethical hacking. Natural disasters such as a fire/flood or earthquake/tsunami or even a power cut can be averted as the data can be stored in several locations so that if the data will be lost including with the hardware this then won't be as big of a problem as the data will still be available but the hardware will have to be replaced.
#### Internal leaks and ethical hacking is one of the most popular types of threats that an organisation may face as these sometimes happen on a regular basis. Internal leaks are when an employee have some specific data that could be vital for the company, this might be for a new product that won't be shown till a certain date. This data can also be something that might expose the company on how they deal with their business or something that might make them lose a lot of revenue. Most companies usually have a non-disclosure form in which the employee must sign so that information cannot be leaked and if they're caught, then the company can sure that person from breaching the form. Accidental leaks can happen as well but is very rare as sometimes accidental leaks may cause more damage to the company. 
#### Ethical hacking usually is done when a hacker is able to find a weakness within a certain part of the company, as it is an easy access point for them. There are also the different types of malicious software that hackers can use such as, Trojan Horse, Worms, Rootkit, etc. Some of these are hard to recognise such as the Trojan Horse as this one hides underneath other files that may go through a firewall and then destroy or corrupt data in the system. A good way of making sure this does not happen, anti-virus checks should occur once a day to make sure that there are not any that have entered the system. Also another way is to have a separate network that is secured from the public and also have a public one so that client may observe the product/service. 

## Group Risks
#### Risks in an organisation can be put into groups, these groups classify the types of risks that affect an organisation, these groups are Physical, Data and Social Engineering.
### Physical:
#### Physical risks are involed with things that interact physically with the system or the user, for example a natural disaster such as fire/flood. This risk is physical as it physically burns the systems or floods through the building where the systems are, these risks do not happen very often and so the solutions for stopping this is just to back up the files and try and keep most of the hardware safe and together to prevent from becoming destroyed. Another risk can be a power cut which can affect when employees are working as this might turn off their systems when working which then cause work that is not saved to not exist anymore, which will affect in time to catch up with that work that was lost.
### Data:
#### Data risks has serveral types of risks such as corruption, destruction of data, data tampering or even theft. These risks are usually done by hackers who try to send off malicious software such as Worm, Trojan Horse and Rootkit which then can corrupt, steal or just destroy data within the system depending on what way they have affected the system. Data risks can also be internal as an employee might send information to another company or purposely leak information to the public. If information was lost of leaked this can then go into the loss of trust in the company as clients might not want to buy from then anymore and will then have the loss of revenue for the company.
### Social Engineering:
#### The final one which is Social Engineering and this is the risk group about social techniques, this is where the attacker will focus on the clients/users of the systems in order to gain access. The way the attack will do this is by either sending a Phishing email that will then acquire the details or by USB baiting which is when a USB is found or placed within a computer, which then the USB that is programmed to install a virus of some kind to then gain access. An easy way of doing this is to make sure that each employee does check emails or other items sent to them to make sure they do not allow anything to get into the system, or to use external USB/hard drives that then might have a virus.

## Security Procedures for Reboot Games
#### In this section this will show all the different types of security procedures within Reboot Games and how they can be achieved. Different companies operate in unique ways that allow the their employees to operate within a set procedures, these are set in place for the employees so that the company can sustainable working as a unit. This allows better security within a company, such as one procedure that is in place for most companies is that each employee must have a form of ID when entering into the building, this means that only personnel who have an ID have access to the building. This procedure allows the company to have a way of protecting it from unwanted individuals from entering the building.
#### Similar procedures of security are also in place within Reboot Games, which also allows the protection for unwanted breaches of security, such as:


### ID pass:
#### Within the college that Reboot Games is located in, there are a set of gates that each student/staff must get through in order to gain access into the college. To enter you must be in the system in case you have misplaced your card or you have your ID that can allow you access through the gates, the ID pass can be retrieved from the college itself and this also has identity onto the college system. There is no other way of bypassing this procedure, unless the individual would obtain one the ID cards that a student has misplaced. The procedure to enter the building is:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Approach Gate
##### 3. Hold correct ID card
##### 4. Place card over required area and wait for light to turn green
##### 5. Wait for gates to open
##### 6. Walk through gate opening
##### 7. Gate closes behind once walked through
#### The steps for this procedure are very basic and despite this they are important when taking safety into consideration, this is because the simple method of ID cards can be very effective at stopping unwanted individuals or groups from coming into the college.

#### In the event that the card is misplaced or that the card is not working on the gates, the following steps must be taken:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Walk to the reception desk and wait in front
##### 3. If there is a queue then wait in the queue
##### 4. Talk to receptionist about gaining entry
##### 5. Acquire either a guest pass or stamp to allow you through
##### 6. Continue to desired location

### Door Lock:
#### The ID card can be used for multiple areas also within the college, if you have the high level access to it. Many doors within the college cannot be opened unless a valid pass is acquired, this means that only personnel that have higher ranking access can enter through those doors. Some students are able to access certain areas as they have been granted access to use that specific room, everyone else is able to access the college but may not be able to access the other rooms unless granted access to it, this is to make sure that only more trusted individuals can have access to the room. In order to gain access you must have the authorized ID card to access these areas, to access certain doors the following steps must be taken:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Pass gate with the previous steps
##### 3. Locate door that you want to access
##### 4. Ensure you have the authroization to access the room
##### 5. Place ID card on required area
##### 6. Wait for red light to turn green and hear lock sound
##### 7. Proceed to push or pull the door to open.
#### This procedure is in place to make sure that if an individual would somehow gain access into the college then they would have to do another step to make it inot more areas within the college, this increases the security of the area as it is another step for any attacker to bypass.

#### In the event of not having a required ID in order to open the door, the following steps must be taken:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Pass gate with the previous steps
##### 3. Locate door you want to access
##### 4. Find member of staff with required ID access
##### 5. Wait for staff member to open the door for you
##### 6. Enter room

### Regular Search:
#### This is a security procedure that occurs a few times during the year. This is done by having a security team at the front of the main gates with metal detectors, this allows both staff and students to be searched to see if they are in possesion of any items in which should not be in the premises. This search is done by the local police and are very beneficial for the college and Reboot Games from not having any dangerous items that may cause problems. The steps that are taken to go through the search are:

##### 1. Enter college
##### 2. Wait in queue
##### 3. Move forward in queue until reach metal detectors
##### 4. Follow police's instructions
##### 5. Have bag searched if in possesion of one
##### 6. Walk through the metal detector when told
##### 7. Retrieve items once completed
#### This procedure may change depending on the time you have entered the college, whether an item has been found or if there is a bigger queue. If there is no queue at all then this step can be skipped entirely.

### Uploading work
#### This procedure is done when business members upload work onto the internet in order for the owners of Reboot Games are able to view it, this is all done on a public domain but it is all subjected to copyright so that the work cannot be plagiarised. This work is all available on this site but can be updated or manually removed by the owner who has created that certain piece of work, because of this level of security means that it is a safe place for the work to be stored. The steps that are taken to access the site and uploard work are:

##### 1. Locate computer system that will be used
##### 2. Turn on system and log into account
##### 3. Use any working search engine
##### 4. Search website 'Github' and login
##### 5. Locate and enter repository of choice
##### 6. Update information on repository
##### 7. Accept changes
#### By regularly checking the public domain and updating any changes needed allows you to make sure that your work is safe and cannot be copied as it is covered by the copyright act.
#### If there is not internet to upload work then follow these steps instead:

##### Turn on systen and log in
##### Open up another text editor e.g. Microsoft Word
##### Write down information that you want to update
##### Save it on a reliable storage device
##### Wait until internet connection is made
##### Copy and paste information into repo and confirm
These procedures are all used to cover different potential vulnerabilities that a system can have, the different stages can only be bypassed if certain procedures are already met, for example unless an ID card is present, the door will not be unlocked. This shows how by having simple security procedures, a company can keep themeselves much safer.

Increasing security in the business
This section is about different ways that Reboot Games can use in order to increase security within the business.
Network security
DMZ's
A DMZ or a Demilitarized Zon is a sub network with the function of splitting and separating an internal or private home LAN from any public networks, this can be used to allow people to access a webpage being hosted on the network, but not be able to access the home network from that. For example an email server can be placed in a DMZ and allow different groups to access the servers, this can come from an internal source or external, however as the server is disconnected from the main LAN it cannot be accessed through the email server.

Adding one of these can be extremely helpful to a companies business as the servers will be able to be safely accessed by all sources without putting the main LAN in danger from being damaged, this can be very important for a company as it means that their personal server is still disconnected from the server clients are accessing. This adds another layer of security to the business and allows safer server management, as well as the event of an attack can much safer as it will only affect the DMZ and not the LAN.

Static IP's
The IP address is used to give a network an address similar to how house numbers and street names work, the IP address can be used to locate the different networks, because of this it can be used to locate if any malicious intent was given. Because it is the address of the network, it is vital for networks to communicate with each other. The difference of a static IP is that it is a manually configured IP that built for a specific device, and will always stay the same with the device unlike IP's that will change with the network.

By having a static IP address it means that security measures can be added to that specific IP address which allows for a lot more configuration and security where as a firewall that follows an ever-changing IP cannot. This method is a consistent way to add another layer of security, although not too thick, the layer that this can add is a very simple and easy way to protect a certain device within the network.

NAT
An Network Address Translation or NAT is a method of giving a device a that is within a private network a public address, the new address will be correctly configured in order to add a layer of security. Because it has this new IP address, the internal IP is hidden and when the network is accessed, it will be accessed by the new public IP instead of the private one, this can add more security to some attacks as the IP address can be targeted in order to access the device however with the public address covering the private.

Potential impact to IT security of incorrect configuration of firewall policies and third party VPNs
This section will be about the different forms of dangers when dealing with VPN's and incorrectly configurd firewalls.
Third party VPN's and internal leaks
Many companies or people at home can use a variety of methods in order to protect their system, many of the methods are common practise, e.g. password safety, firewall etc. One method that people will use is setting up a VPN (Vitual Party Network), VPN's are used to allow safe data transfer online, usually when sending data, the packets would have to travel through public domains in order to be successfuly transferred. However, a VPN is a private connection that involves two ip addresses connecting with each other privatly, this means that when the two systems want to transfer files or data to each other, they can go through a private network rather than risking putting it on a public domain in which it could be seen and tracked.

Whilst having these implemented are extremely useful for whoever sets it up, there can be very big drawbacks when using third party VPN's, since it is a private network, it needs to have a provider, many different companies offer VPN's however it can be quite risky when acquiring a VPN this way. This is because whilst it is a private network, there are many ways that the data within this network can be leaked. Whether by accident or intentional, there can be leaks of data that can betray the entire point of the private network and can impact a company quite heavily depending on the type of data leaked, if the data is extremely important then it could potentially be fatal for the business.

Wrong firewall configuation
VPN's can keep data safe when being transferred across systems, however it isn't the only thing that can protect data when being transferred, it is common knowledge of what firewalls do, they protect your computer from bad packets that are coming into the system. However because of how it functions by allowing access to some packets and blocking packets that aren't allowed in, whether it is because they are harmful or because it is against the admins rules. If the firewall in configured incorrectly, it can mean that many packets that are not harmful but actually important can be lost when sent, this can cause many private data to be lost that is vital for the user. Having data lost within the system that is important to certain projects can cause many different problems ranging from trivial to fatal, also from the other side, properly configured firewalls keep malicious packets out whereas firewalls that are not properly configured will allow malicious packets in after thinking they are good.

Disaster recovery
This section will be about different recovery steps when a disaster occurs within Reboot Games
When dealing with risks in a business, there are moments in which if the risk is successful in hindering the business in any major way, then the business must have plans ready to make sure that the damage can be contained and managed so that it does not prove fatal for the business. There are many different steps to make sure that this process of recovery is successful.

The Recovery process and recovery time
This is where the business will look at the different pieces of work that they have done and prioritise them depending on their importance on the company, the more important assests of the business will have more protection as if they are lost or stolen, it will be more difficult to recover from, becuase of this, assests that are not as important will not be prioritised and in the event of an attack, will be the first assests that will be lost if it is successful. This step within the disaster recover plan is very important as it means that the major assests are protected and prioritised which in the event of a risk can be very helpful.

The recovery time is the simplist step in the disaster recovery process, this is because it is all about the recovery process being completed as quickly as possible, being able to define a time for the systems and data to be recovered before a disaster occurs means that there will be a more organised recovery plan, and will allow the business know an estimated time of when operations will be running again. As well as this it can be used to identify flaws in the recovery process if there is a system that takes longer than the estimated time taken, it can then be analysed and can be focused on in order to speed up the recovery time of the system.

Communication plan
This is called a communication plan amd involves making sure that the communication between the business employees is set to the task at hand and that the right questions are always being asked when the disaster is occuring so that it leads to the disaster being recovered quickly. As communication will be very important during the disaster it means that these plans can be very beneficial for the disaster recovery plan if don correctly.

Defining roles to employees
If a disaster occurs, it is important that the employees know exactly what they are doing so that confusion between them is removed, by giving specific tasks within the disaster, it means that there is some more organisation when dealing with the disaster. The biggest part of a successful recovery is being able to keep the process clean and organised and by not defining roles it can mean that there could be chaos within the business whilst trying to deal with the disaster.

Testing schedule
By testing regularly it means that the business can see how the disaster recovery operates and they will be able to reflect on the work done by the business and how they delt with the disaster. It also prepares people for the disaster if it does occur and gives people an idea of how the process works ultimatly giving a higher chance of success if a disaster occurs.

## How to keep your system Secure

Here i will show a list of things that you could do to try and keep your system secure:

HTTPS

Everyone should already know what this means and why it is there. So having HTTPS means that the website you are surfing on is secure from any threats that may try to go into that specific website. If it does not have the 'S' on the end which stands for Secure this means that that specific website can have some threats to access through into that website and then possibly onto your system.

HTTPS EVERYWHERE(check each website that it has HTTPS) TOR/VPN AD BLOCKERS Avoid using patterns in passwords Logout accounts Use Incognito Use Non-traceable Search Engines such as DuckDuckGo Use different emails for Public usage and for Personal usage. Don’t share personal information Turn off your mics Turn off location history Turn off camera/webcam on laptop Turn off bluetooth Use different passwords Always check the url when browse websites Clear cookies and history often
